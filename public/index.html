      <p>If this is you, you're in the right place...</p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of ways people can get video games. It seems that almost
        any device with a screen and an input device can be a platform for a
        video game of some sort
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide will walk you through some of the common devices and genres
        available to choose from and provide a basic understanding of what's
        involved with each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a device, there is no video game. See the devices page to browse
        details of some of the common devices to see what interests you.
