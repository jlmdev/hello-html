        Consoles have been around commercially since the early 1970's. The first
        models played only games built into the hardware itself. This gave way
        to cartridges, cd-rom, and DVDs by the early 2000's.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern consoles can connect to televisions or monitors and can either
        accept insertable media or downloads from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>As of this writing, there are three main competitors in this space:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sony PlayStation 4</li>
        <li>Microsoft Xbox One X</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch</li>
      </ul>

        Personal computers are omnipresent. However, for more graphically
        intensive games, a higher end computer and graphics card are often
        required. This can get expensive quickly. They offer the most powerful
        options currently, but affordability is definitely a factor.

        Mobile devices are everywhere and most of the current smartphones have
        options for buying and playing games. The games are usually much more
        affordable for these devices due to competition on their respective "App
        Stores".
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some potential downsides, though. Screen size, processor
        power, device storage capacity, and limitations of a touch screen are
        often limiting factors on what kinds of game can be played on them.
